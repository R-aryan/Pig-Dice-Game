### Pig-Dice-Game


Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous gains by rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games, the object is to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score (e.g. Pig, Pass the Pigs, Cosmic Wimpout, Can't Stop). In jeopardy approach games, the object is to most closely approach a goal score without exceeding it.

### Gameplay

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":


- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

### The first player to score 100 or more points wins or the winning score can be set by the player
